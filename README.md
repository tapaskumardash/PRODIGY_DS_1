# PRODIGY_DS_1
Task-1: Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

# Population Age Distribution Visualization
This Python script generates a bar chart to visualize the age distribution in a population using data from an Excel file. It utilizes pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, and numpy for numerical operations. The script reads the Excel file, handles missing values, computes median ages, and plots the bar chart. The chart provides insights into the distribution of age categories (0-14, 15-64, 65+). The script is useful for demographic analysis and can be adapted for various population datasets.
